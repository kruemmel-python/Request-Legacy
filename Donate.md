### ❤️ Support the Unconventional: Beyond Standard Programming

I don't just write code; I explore paths others wouldn't take. Developed entirely in my private free time, my work is about challenging the status quo of software development. Whether I’m performing "Digital Archaeology" to resurrect abandoned giants like **Request-Legacy 3.0.0** or building highly integrated physical-logic models like **Material Forge**, my goal is to inspire people to think beyond the limits of standard programming.

Your support enables me to continue this journey—finding new ways in my spare time, bridging the gap between "Spirit" and "Body" in tech, and sharing these unconventional solutions with the world.
